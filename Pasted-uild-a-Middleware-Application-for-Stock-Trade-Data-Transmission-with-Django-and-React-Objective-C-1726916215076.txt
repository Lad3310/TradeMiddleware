uild a Middleware Application for Stock Trade Data Transmission with Django and React

Objective:

Create a middleware application that:

	•	Receives stock trade data in various popular formats.
	•	Processes and transmits the data to an external API (to be specified later).
	•	Provides a web interface for users to log in and view an audit trail of file transmissions and processed trades.

Backend Requirements:

	1.	Framework & Language:
	•	Use Django (Python) for the backend development.
	2.	Data Ingestion:
	•	Accept stock trade data in multiple formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).
	•	Implement API endpoints and web interfaces for uploading files and receiving data streams.
	•	Use libraries like Pandas for parsing different data formats.
	3.	Data Processing:
	•	Parse and validate incoming trade data.
	•	Normalize data into a standard internal format.
	•	Handle data inconsistencies and provide meaningful error messages.
	4.	Data Transmission:
	•	Transmit processed trade data to an external API (placeholder for now).
	•	Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for failed transmissions.
	•	Use asynchronous tasks with Celery to handle background processing and retries.
	5.	Audit Logging:
	•	Record all file transmissions with details like timestamp, status, and user.
	•	Log individual trade processing statuses within each file.
	•	Store logs in a database for easy retrieval and display.
	6.	Authentication & Security:
	•	Implement user authentication using Django’s built-in authentication system.
	•	Ensure secure data transmission using HTTPS (SSL/TLS certificates).
	•	Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
	7.	Database:
	•	Use PostgreSQL as the database backend.
	•	Utilize Django’s ORM for database interactions.
	8.	API Development:
	•	Develop RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework for frontend communication.
	•	Ensure APIs are well-documented and versioned.

Frontend Requirements:

	1.	Framework & Language:
	•	Use React for the frontend development.
	2.	User Interface:
	•	Develop a responsive web dashboard for users to log in.
	•	Display an audit trail of all file transmissions showing accepted and rejected files.
	•	Provide functionalities to upload trade data files.
	3.	Detailed Views:
	•	Allow users to click on a file to see detailed information about each trade processed.
	•	Display statuses (processed, pending, failed) for individual trades.
	•	Include search and filter options for ease of navigation.
	4.	Authentication:
	•	Implement secure login functionality.
	•	Manage user sessions securely using JWT or session tokens.
	•	Ensure proper handling of authentication states on the frontend.
	5.	UI/UX Design:
	•	Use UI component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design for a professional look and feel.
	•	Ensure the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.
	6.	API Integration:
	•	Interact with the backend APIs for data retrieval and submission.
	•	Handle API responses and display appropriate messages to the user.

Additional Requirements:

	•	Scalability:
	•	Design the application architecture to handle high volumes of trade data efficiently.
	•	Optimize database queries and use pagination where necessary.
	•	Configurability:
	•	Allow easy configuration of the external API endpoint and authentication details via environment variables or admin settings.
	•	Documentation:
	•	Provide clear setup and usage instructions in a README file.
	•	Include inline comments and documentation within the code for maintainability.
	•	Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or DRF’s built-in documentation.
	•	Testing:
	•	Write unit tests for backend logic and components.
	•	Implement integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.
	•	Use testing frameworks like PyTest for Python and Jest for React.
	•	Deployment:
	•	Containerize the application using Docker.
	•	Provide Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for easy setup and deployment.
	•	Ensure the application can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
	•	Version Control:
	•	Use Git for version control.
	•	Structure commits logically and provide meaningful commit messages.

Notes:

	•	Extensibility:
	•	Since the external API is not yet specified, design the system with a service layer or adapter pattern to accommodate future integration with minimal changes.
	•	Error Handling:
	•	Implement comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend.
	•	Provide user-friendly error messages and logging for debugging.
	•	Security Best Practices:
	•	Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
	•	Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
	•	Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
	•	Performance Optimization:
	•	Use caching mechanisms like Redis to improve performance where applicable.
	•	Optimize frontend assets and use code splitting in React to reduce load times.
	•	Project Structure:
	•	Organize code in a modular and scalable way.
	•	Follow best practices for Django and React project structures.

Deliverables:

	•	A fully functional middleware application meeting the above requirements.
	•	Source code hosted in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
	•	Deployment scripts and instructions.
	•	Documentation covering setup, usage, and any other pertinent details.

Final Thoughts:

As I am new to software development, I rely on your expertise to implement this project effectively. If you have suggestions for better technologies or architectural improvements that suit these requirements, please feel free to incorporate them.

Summary:

Please build a middleware application using Django for the backend and React for the frontend that can:

	•	Receive and process stock trade data in various formats.
	•	Transmit processed data to an external API.
	•	Provide a secure web interface for users to upload files and view processing results.
	•	Ensure the application is secure, scalable, and well-documented.
